Our project is the "Library Management System." This system can be used in libraries to view all the available books, add new books to the library, lend books to customers, track the due dates for the return of books, etc. This application will be a windows-based desktop application. The front end/UI will be designed using WPF, while the backend will be processed using C#. SQL Server will be used to store databases.
