# Introduction

I would like to develop Library Management System which can be used by librarians to lend books to the customers and maintain records for tracking. This sytem also include sending automated emails to the customers whose due dates are near. It contains features like adding new customer, deleting existing customer, adding new books to the store along with the location where they were placed, searching for the book availability, tracking of late return fee and etc.

# Anticipated Technologies

I will be developing a Windows Desktop Application and will use .Net framework. Technologies used will be WPF, XAML in the front end and C# for the middle tier and back end with SQL server as the database server.

# Method/Approach

I will be using the MVVM(Model View ViewModel) design pattern, Will first develop the design, includes UI design, classes that are needed, what attributes and methods are needed in each class and then will design the database according to the classes so that it will be easy for me to map the classes with database tables through entity relationship. I will then develop the front end part including all the screens and provide menu to navigate to these screens. Will then write the databinding for the UI and the class objects to detrmine what data needs to be shown in which part of the UI. Then I will develop the functionality of the application. Will now test the application and fix all the bugs that were produced. 

# Estimated Timeline

* Design: One week
* Design Database: 3 days.
* Develop UI: 3 Days
* Develop classes in the Model: 3 days
* Map classes to the DB: 4 days
* Databinding to the UI: 5 days
* Business Logic: 2 Weeks
* Unit Testing: 2 days
* Integration Testing: 2 days
* System Testing: 1 day

# Anticipated Problems

* Data binding can become messier and may end up giving data the the wrong components of the UI.
* Need to develop classes carefully or else the complete design needs to be changes.
* Must choose appropriate design patterns in order to increase reusability and decrease changing multiple components when design is changed.
* Need to test individual components of the UI in unit testing to make sure correct data i being shown in the UI
